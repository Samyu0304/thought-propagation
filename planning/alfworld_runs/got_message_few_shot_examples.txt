Successful Case:
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a cabinet 6, a cabinet 5, a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a coffeemachine 1, a countertop 3, a countertop 2, a countertop 1, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a fridge 1, a garbagecan 1, a microwave 1, a shelf 3, a shelf 2, a shelf 1, a sinkbasin 1, a stoveburner 4, a stoveburner 3, a stoveburner 2, a stoveburner 1, and a toaster 1.
Your task is to: heat some potato and put it in garbagecan.
> think: To solve the task, I need to find and take a potato, then heat it with microwave, then put it in garbagecan.
OK.
> think: First I need to find a potato. A potato is more likely to appear in fridge (1), countertop (1-3), stoveburner (1-4), toaster (1), garbagecan (1), cabinet (1-6). I can check one by one, starting with countertop 1.
OK.
> go to countertop 1
On the countertop 1, you see a mug 3, a potato 1, a saltshaker 3, and a spatula 1.
> take potato 1 from countertop 1
You pick up the potato 1 from the countertop 1.
> think: Now I take a potato (1). Next, I need to go to a microwave (1) and heat it.
OK.
> go to microwave 1
The microwave 1 is closed.
> heat potato 1 with microwave 1
You heat the potato 1 using the microwave 1.
> think: Now I heat a potato (1). Next, I need to put it in/on garbagecan 1.
OK.
> go to garbagecan 1
On the garbagecan 1, you see a apple 2, a dishsponge 2, and a egg 2.
> put potato 1 in/on garbagecan 1
You put the potato 1 in/on the garbagecan 1.

Failure Case:
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a cabinet 10, a cabinet 9, a cabinet 8, a cabinet 7, a cabinet 6, a cabinet 5, a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a coffeemachine 1, a countertop 2, a countertop 1, a diningtable 2, a diningtable 1, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a fridge 1, a garbagecan 1, a microwave 1, a sinkbasin 1, a stoveburner 4, a stoveburner 3, a stoveburner 2, a stoveburner 1, and a toaster 1.
Your task is to: heat some mug and put it in coffeemachine.
> think: To solve the task, I need to find and take a mug, then heat it with stoveburner, then put it in coffeemachine.
Ok.
> look
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see nothing.
> think: First I need to find a mug. A mug is more likely to appear in countertop (1-2), diningtable (1-2), drawer (1-3), fridge (1), sinkbasin (1), stoveburner (1-4), toaster (1). I can check one by one, starting with countertop 1.
Ok.
> look
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see nothing.
> go to countertop 1
On the countertop 1, you see a butterknife 1, a cup 1, a fork 2, and a mug 1.
> think: Now I find a mug (1). Next, I need to take it.
Ok.
> take mug 1 from countertop 1
You pick up the mug 1 from the countertop 1.
> think: Now I take a mug (1). Next, I need to heat it with stoveburner (1-4).
Ok.
> go to stoveburner 1
On the stoveburner 1, you see a pan 2.
> examine stoveburner 1
On the stoveburner 1, you see a pan 2.
> examine stoveburner 1
On the stoveburner 1, you see a pan 2.
> examine stoveburner 1
On the stoveburner 1, you see a pan 2.
> examine stoveburner 1
On the stoveburner 1, you see a pan 2.

Plan: In the successful case, I heat potato 1 with microwave 1 after I find potato 1 and arrive at microwave 1. In the failure case, I was stuck in a loop in which I continually examined stoveburner 1 instead of heating mug 1 with stoveburner 1. I should have taken mug 1 from countertop 1, then heated it with stoveburner 1. After that, I should put mug 1 in coffeemachine 1. It did not help to execute two identical actions in a row. I will try to execute a different action if I am stuck in a loop again.
